**More:**<br>
I work as a full-stack developer (Laravel+Vue) in a company from the financial and credit sector, team leader in the development of a personal account. Made the project from layout to release. I know from the inside how companies in the financial sector work with their scoring, equifaxes, telephony, recalculations, complex business logic and many microservices. I understand other people's code.
Worked as a team co-founder of a startup 2016-2020, won grant competitions. I run my own business of creating turnkey websites. Worked in the IT department of the KAMAZ state corporation. Every day I improve my programming skills. Ready to learn and experience something new. I lead a healthy lifestyle and do charity work. I love Laravel+Vue (my main stack), I‚Äôm ready to dive into some other languages and frameworks (for example NodeJS, Express, TS). I don‚Äôt like 1C-Bitrix, although I have a little experience with it; as for CMS, I prefer WP in conjunction with Elementor - I have made a large number of commercially successful sites and contributed to this combination of technologies.
